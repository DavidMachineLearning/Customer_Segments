# Creating Customer Segments 
#### (part of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree)

Apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 

Explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another.

Preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying and removing unwanted outliers. 

Apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data.

Finally, compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
